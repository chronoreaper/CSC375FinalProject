This is the final project for CSCC375

The main files are actorcritic.py and dqn.py
These both run a machine learning algorithm using the actorcritic policy and the dqn policy respectively.
env.py is the claw machine environment.
agents.py and models.py are the actor critic agents and critic respectively.
kukaclaw.py is the kuka robot arm with a few modifications

Dependency Needed to run dqn.py: pip install stable-baselines3
Simply execute either autocritic.py or dqn.py and the PyBullet simulation will begin. To turn off rendering of the simulation, change renders=False in the file.
